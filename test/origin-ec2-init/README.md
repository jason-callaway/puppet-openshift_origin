# About

This script is an effort to make the openshift_origin Puppet module work better on Amazon EC2 instances.  It's currently being tested against the Fedora Core 18 Cloud Image, [ami-b71078de](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Cloud_images).

Once the logic is stable, I'll add it to the Puppet module, include some documentation, and issue a pull request.
